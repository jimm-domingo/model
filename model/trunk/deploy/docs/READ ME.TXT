Beginning with LANDIS-II v6.0, examples are provided with each extension.  These examples
will include a complete set of scenario files with a batch file in a separate sub-directory.
These example files are identical to those used to test extension results.  Therefore, the
user can download and quickly run new extensions without altering other extension examples.
