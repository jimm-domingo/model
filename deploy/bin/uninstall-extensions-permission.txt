Dear Mr. van der Woude ~

I am writing to request permission to deploy a modified copy of GetUninstall.bat with our LANDIS-II forest landscape simulation model. Our model is an open source tool written in C# that simulates forest succession, disturbance (including fire, wind, harvesting, insects), climate change, and seed dispersal across large landscapes.

A copy of our code repository may be found here: https://code.google.com/p/landis-extensions/. 

The open architecture of our tool allows anyone to write an extension to simulate a forest process. Due to the distributed nature of extension development, it is difficult to manage the uninstallation of the model since each extension has its own installer.

I found your GetUninstall.bat script got me 90% there. With a few modifications, I was able to deploy it with my model installer and use it to uninstall the LANDIS-II extensions at the same time the core model is uninstalled. 

Would it be possible to deploy a modified version of your script with our model? 

Thanks for your consideration. -- Lesley Bross

Thanks so much Rob ~

Is there any supporting documentation that I should keep with the script in my distribution? I have already included the attribution that you published originally with the script: author's name and website.

Hello Lesley,

I did not create any documentation, the short help screen text is all I ever wrote. So there is no need to include any readme, as far as I'm concerned. You may of course add your own documentation if necessary.

Thanks for including the attribution.
